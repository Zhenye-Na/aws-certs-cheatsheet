- IAM (Identity Access Management) allows you to manage users, groups, permissions (level of access) to the AWS console
- S3 (Simple Storage Service) provides a files storage service

IAM has a **global** view, not like EC2 or S3 has a **Region**


### IAM Features

IAM offers the following features:

1. Centralized control of your AWS account
2. Shared Access to your AWS account
3. Granular Permissions
4. Identity Federation (Active Directory, Github ...)
5. Multi-Factor Authentication
6. Provide temporary access for users/devices and services where necessary
7. Allows you to set up your password rotation policy
8. integrates with many different AWS services
9. Support PCI DSS Compliance

### Terminology of IAM

Next, let's get familiar with some terminology of IAM:

- Users, Groups, Roles (I think these are naive so I just list them here)
- Policies, this is a JSON formatted file, call **Policy Document**

## IAM - Advanced

### AWS STS - Security Token Service

- Allows granting limited and temporary access to AWS resources
- Token is valid for up to one hour (must be refreshed)
- `AssumeRole`
- `AssumeRoleWithSAML`
- `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`
- `GetSessionToken`

#### Using STS to Assume a Role

- Define an IAM Role within your account or cross-account
- Define which principals can access this IAM Role
- Use AWS STS to retrieve credentials and impersonate the IAM Role you have access to (`AssumeRole` API)
- Temporary credentials can be valid between 15 minutes to 1 hour

### Directory Services

- AWS Managed Microsoft AD
  - Create your AD in AWS, manage users locally, supports MFA
  - Establish **trust connections** with your on-premise AD
- AD Connector
  - Directory Gateway (**proxy**) to redirect to on-premise AD
  - Users are managed on the on-premise AD
- Simple AD
  - AD-compatible managed directory on AWS
  - Cannot be joined with on-premise AD

## AWS Organizations

- Global service
- Allows managing multiple AWS accounts
- The main account is the master account (cannot change this)
- Other accounts are member accounts
- Member accounts can only be part of one organization
- Consolidated billing across all accounts - one payment method
- API is available to automate AWS account creation

### Organization Units (OU)

### Service Control Policies (SCP)

SCP contains Allowlist or denylist IAM actions and can be applied at the `Root`, `OU`, or `Account` level

- SCP is applied to all the Users and Roles of the Account, including Root
- The SCP does not affect service-linked roles
  - service-linked roles enable other AWS services to integrate with AWS Organizations and cannot be restricted by SCPs
- SCP must have an explicit `Allow` rule (since it does not allow anything by default)

> some use cases:
>
> 1. Restrict access to certain services (like customer team cannot use EC2, but can use S3)
> 2. Enforce PCI compliance by explicitly disabling services

#### SCP Hierarchy

### AWS Organizations - Moving Accounts

Migrate accounts from Organization A to Organization B

1. Remove the member account from Organization A
2. Send an invite to Organization B
3. Accept the invite from the member account


Migrate master (or primary) account of Organization A to Organization B

1. Remove the member account from Organization A
2. <u>Delete Organization A</u>
3. Repeat the process above to invite the old master account to Organization B


### Advanced IAM

#### IAM Roles vs Resource-Based Policies

Attach a policy to a resource versus attaching of a using a role as a proxy (STS)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zhenye-Na/img-hosting-picgo/master/img/iam-roles-vs-resource-based-policies.png)


- When you assume a role (user, application, or service), you give up your original permissions and take the permissions assigned to the role
- When using a **resource-based policy**, the principal does not have to give up his permissions

### IAM - Policy Evaluation Logic

![](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/images/PolicyEvaluationHorizontal.png)

As soon as there is an explicit deny, the result will be denied


```json
"Statement": [
    {
        "Action": "sqs:*",
        "Effect": "Deny",
        "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
        "Action": [
            "sqs:DeleteQueue"
        ],
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Resource": "*"
    }
]
```

- sqs:CreateQueue -> NO
- sqs:DeleteQueue -> NO, since there is an explicit DENY
- ec2:DescribeInstances -> NO, there is no explicit ALLOW


#### AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM)

- Share AWS resources that you own with other AWS accounts
- Share with any account or within your Organization
- VPC Subnets, AWS Transit Gateway, Route53 Resolver Rules, License Manager Configurations


### AWS Single Sign-On (SSO)

- Centrally manage Single Sign-On to access multiple accounts and 3rd party business applications
- Integrated with **AWS Organizations**
- Support **SAML 2.0** markup
- Integration with on-premise **Active Directory**
- Centralized permission management
- Centralized auditing with CloudTrail

#### SSO vs `AssumeRoleWithSAML`
